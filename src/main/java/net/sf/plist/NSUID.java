/**
 * A NSUID object is rarely seen in the wild.
 * Therefore it is difficult to come up with a good API for it.
 * PLEASE NOTE THAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE NSUID IS LIMITED,
 * AND THEREFORE THIS API COULD TURN OUT TO BE WRONG
 * AND WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED. 
 * 
 * Apple's own Property List Editor (part of XCode)
 * completely ignores the NSUID.
 * By using Apple's QuickLook to convert the Property List to XML code,
 * the NSUID object is converted into a NSDictionary with one entry;
 * the key is always CF$UID and the value is
 * the unsigned 32bits integer value contained within the NSUID.
 * 
 * So far I have only seen the NSUID files
 * in the temporary .appdownload files
 * Mac OS X writes when downloading an app from the Mac App Store.
 * These files have four NSUID values; 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 and 0x04.
 * It is still unclear what these values represent.
 * They could point to objects in the object table
 * but that seems to be unlikely, given the results that would produce.
 * 
 * Because the CF$UID is a Number and
 * QuickLook represents the NSUID as a NSDictionary,
 * it is difficult to choose where NSUID should extend from,
 * {@link NSNumber} or {@link NSDictionary}.
 * Because I can not make a well informed choice
 * we will inheirit from {@link NSObject} for now.
 * 
 * {@link #toMap()} and {@link #toList()} are overridden to return a single entry.
 * The key of the entry in the map is {@value #CFUIDKEY}.
